# Next.js Data Fetching Error: Silent 500 Errors

This repository demonstrates a common but often overlooked error in Next.js applications involving data fetching within `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` functions.  When fetching data from an external API, unexpected responses (e.g., network issues, API downtime) can lead to silent 500 errors in production, making debugging difficult.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, and `bugSolution.js` offers a solution incorporating more robust error handling.

## Problem

The original code lacks proper error handling for API requests.  If the API returns an error, the `res.json()` call might throw an exception, crashing the server without a meaningful error message displayed to the user.

## Solution

The improved code includes a `try...catch` block to gracefully handle potential errors during the API request and JSON parsing.  It logs errors to the console for debugging purposes and provides more informative error responses to users when appropriate.
